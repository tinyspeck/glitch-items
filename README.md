Reserved" license — you may do what you please with what we've provided. Our 
intention is to dedicate these works to the public domain and make them freely 
available to all, without restriction.

All files are provided AS-IS. Tiny Speck cannot provide any support to help you 
bring these assets into your own projects. Many of these files are not 
structured in a standard, straightforward way, and they may take a bit of 
your time and work to understand.

Note: the Glitch logo and trademark are *not* among the things we are making 
available under this license. Only items in the files explicitly included 
herein are covered.

There is no obligation to link or credit the works, but if you do, please link 
to <a href="http://glitchthegame.com">glitchthegame.com</a>, our permanent 
"retirement" site for the game and these assets. Of course, links/shoutouts to 
Tiny Speck (<a href="http://tinyspeck.com">tinyspeck.com</a>) and/or Slack 
(<a href="http://slack.com">slack.com</a>) are appreciated.

## What you'll find in here: ##

If it's not a location and it's not an avatar, it's probably in here. Anything
you ate, drank, talked to, petted, mined, squeezed, crafted, tithed to, carved,
quested, planted, ground, spun, played, seasoned, gassified, opened, and raced
is somewhere in this mostly organized yet intimidatingly cluttered repository of nearly all things Ur.

## Documentation Contributions Are Welcome! ##

If you figure something out that you think others could learn from, write up a 
quick how-to document and submit it to us as a pull request. Share your 
knowledge!
